1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?  

I can take good notes and also ask questions so i can get enough details tp what features they need. This will help with getting the features on the project right the first time.  User stories help with keeping organized notes on the user request. It does this breaking them down by importance and how much work will be needed to accomplish it.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work? 

I approach developing programs by taking notes and putting everything in order and writing a plan of attack. The agile processes I hope to incorporate into my future development work is taking time daily to examine what I accomplished and what I still need to work on, and working on each task in increments rather than scrambling to accomplish as many things as possible.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?  

Being a good team member means putting the team and project before yourself.  If you say you are going to do something make you do it. It is impotant to be a good communicator and always communicating with the team even if it isnt good news. I want to be someone my team can count on.
